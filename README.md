Plotting High Dimensional Data

The examples for how to visuaize decisionSupport MC results are in the MC_Examples folder
The 'mcSimulationResults.csv' file comes out of each analysis and can be mined for visualizations 

See the folder 'MC_Examples' examples for how to extract and compare model outputs from decisionSupport
See the folder 'Radial' for examples of how to plot some interesting things (mostly covered in the vignette)

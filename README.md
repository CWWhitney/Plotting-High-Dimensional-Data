Plotting High Dimensional Data

The examples for how to visuaize decisionSupport MC results are in the MC_Examples folder
The 'mcSimulationResults.csv' file comes out of each analysis and can be mined for visualizations 

See the folder 'MC_Examples' examples for how to extract and compare model outputs from decisionSupport. To use this example please download the decisonSupport output files from Dropbox <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u20heealspgtw86/AADgFCI4XTzEqNm0v0s4q932a?dl=0>. These are unfortunately too heavy for GitHub. 

See the folder 'Radial' for R script examples of how to plot some interesting things (mostly covered in the vignette).
